Through Arduino, use a USB keyboard as a MIDI controller for a music device.

Tested on Genius SlimStar 130 (GK-150001) keyboard, Arduino UNO R3 board, Volca Kick analogue kick generator (firmware v 1.05, date 2019-09-10).

Note: I learned *some* music theory in middle school, sorry if something for any music crime.

## Setup

### Libraries

You'll need the `MIDI` library by Francois Best.\
It's downloaded through the Arduino IDE library manager.

### Keyboard-Arduino connection

## Functions

### Music keyboard

The next section (Octave selector) addresses changing octave/pitch.

| Key | Note       | Note alt name     |
|-----|------------|-------------------|
| z   | do         | C                 |
| s   | re♭ / do♯  | D minor / C mayor |
| x   | re         | D                 |
| d   | mi♭ / re♯  | E minor / D mayor |
| C   | mi         | E                 |
| V   | fa         | F                 |
| G   | sol♭ / fa♯ | G minor / C mayor |
| B   | sol        | G                 |
| H   | la♭ / sol♯ | A minor / C mayor |
| N   | la         | A                 |
| J   | si♭ / la♯  | B minor / C mayor |
| M   | si         | B                 |

### Octave selector

Default = 1.\
Press one of this keys to change the octave of the keyboard (pitch?).\
Note: You might want to switch to octave 4 first, it's the middle one, [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave "Octave - Wikipedia").
